me=Me

# Personal Information
self_intro=I'm Geovani Debastiani and I'm 19 years old, a coffee enthusiast living in Brazil - Santa Catarina.

# Education and Career
education_intro=In 2017 I started studying programming with Small Basic in a course for which I received a scholarship.
education_self_study=From that point on, I began self-studying at home, focusing on systems and RPA'S development with Python.
job_2020=In 2020 I got my first job in my life as a Young Apprentice at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/karsten-s.a./">Karsten</a>, where I worked alongside seamstress. It was an amazing experience, and even though it was a simple job, I learned a lot with them!
job_2022=In 2022, I started working in this big world of programming, still as a Young Apprentice, but this time at  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/teclogica/">Teclógica</a>, where I had training for work with web development with Java, JSF, Primefaces, and Postgresql. It was an excellent experience, and it was during this time that I encountered my first challenges in my career, a moment I will never forget.
promotion_2023=In July of 2023, while still in the same company, I had the opportunity to become a Junior Developer. One of my dreams has come true!! I continued working with the same stack but also began learning Kotlin to work on our mobile software.

# Language Learning
language_learning=Since 2022, I've been studying English, something I discovered I really enjoy. I'm learning to use it at work, and in the future, I intend to move to another country.
